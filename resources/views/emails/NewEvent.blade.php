<p>Dear {{$owner->name}},</p>

<p>Your event has been created!</p>

<p>If you haven't done so already, you will need to add at least one competition to your event before you can publish it on the website and start accepting entries. You can do this from your event dashboard: <a href="http://www.foresightentries.com/events/{{$event->slug}}/admin">http://www.foresightentries.com/events/{{$event->slug}}/admin</a>.</p>

<p>When you are ready to accept entries, your event can be published on the website from the dashboard.</p>

<p>Many thanks,<br>
The Foresight Entries Team</p>
