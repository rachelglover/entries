<div class="tab-pane" id="communications">
    This is the communications tab. The organiser can download a list of email addresses (in a nice cut and paste format) so they
    can email their competitors. Mass mailings from our site mean replies would be a bit tricky (unless we mask it like
    it's coming from the event organiser?). Prob easier to start with a downloadable list in a text file.
