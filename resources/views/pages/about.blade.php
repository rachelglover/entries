                <p class="lead">The idea for Foresight Entries was born out of frustration with the traditional way entries to shooting competitions were handled. If you were lucky enough to know someone who had received an entry form via email, you then had to print it out, fill it in, write a cheque, find a stamp and post it back to the organiser. If you were unlucky, the cheque wouldn't be cashed until months after the competition had taken place, when you'd forgotten all about it!</p>
                <p class="lead">We decided there was a better way: an entries website. You can see how many places are left for each competition and pay online with your card. Event organisers would have less paper work to deal with and no trips to the bank to deposit cheques. Welcome to ForesightEntries.com!</p>
